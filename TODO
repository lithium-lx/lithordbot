- add a reload command
- a debug mode, tied in with the CLi
- expanding the CLI to be acuatlly useful (writing a real command handler) and with the following capabilities:
    - reloading commands
    - (re-)loading modules
    - giving commands a way to interact with the CLI (should only be active in a debug mode)
        - msgirage (Faking messages by creating a message object and sending it through /src/events/message.js)
        - Monitor commands being executed
- Making new modules user-installable (probably through a nodejs terminal tool (npm run-script add-module))
- (far future) make the bot aware of other instances of itself (on other servers) and interact with them (data sharing, etc.)
- expand /src/events/message.js
    - More advanced permission system (through /src/functions/perms.js OR
    /modules/advanced_perms with permissions.json giving the perms handler: msg(member, channel, roles, timestamp))
