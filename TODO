- add a reload command
- a debug mode, tied in with the CLi
- expanding the CLI to be acuatlly useful (writing a real command handler) and with the following capabilities:
    - reloading commands
    - (re-)loading modules
    - giving commands a way to interact with the CLI (should only be active in a debug mode)
- Making new modules user-installable (probably through a nodejs terminal tool (npm run-script add-module))
- (far future) make the bot aware of other instances of itself (on other servers) and interact with them (data sharing, etc.)
